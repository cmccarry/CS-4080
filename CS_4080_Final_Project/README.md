# CS 4080 Project: Blog Website

This project is a simple blog website built using PHP and MySQL. Users can create accounts, log in, write blog posts, and comment on each otherâ€™s posts. The project demonstrates fundamental web development concepts, including user authentication, CRUD operations, and relational database handling in MySQL.


## Project Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out securely.
- **Blog Posts**: Logged-in users can create, edit, and delete their own blog posts.
- **Comments**: Users can comment on any post and delete their own comments.
- **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile page displaying their posts and comments, along with options to change their username and password.
- **Pagination and Filtering**: Blog posts are paginated for easier browsing, and users can filter posts by author.
- **Responsive Design**: The website layout is styled with CSS to be responsive and user-friendly.
